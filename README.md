This code is designed to work with a keypad and a 16x2 LCD display connected to an Arduino board. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the keypad and display the result on the LCD.

To use this code, you will need to have the Keypad and LiquidCrystal libraries installed in your Arduino IDE. If you don't have them installed, you can install them by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries and searching for "Keypad" and "LiquidCrystal".

Once you have the libraries installed, you can upload the code to your Arduino board. Make sure that you have connected the keypad and LCD to the correct pins on your board, as specified in the code.

To perform arithmetic operations, simply press the corresponding buttons on the keypad. The LCD will display the numbers and operation being performed, as well as the result if the "=" button is pressed.

If you encounter any errors while running the code, refer to the troubleshooting section of this README for possible solutions.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter any errors while running the code, try the following solutions:

1. Make sure that you have installed the Keypad and LiquidCrystal libraries correctly. You can do this by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries in the Arduino IDE and searching for the libraries. If they are not installed, click on Install.

2. Check that you have spelled the library names correctly in your code. They should be #include <Keypad.h> and #include <LiquidCrystal.h>, with capital letters.

3. Make sure that you have declared the Keypad and LiquidCrystal objects correctly in your code. They should look something like this: Keypad kpd = Keypad(makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, ROWS, COLS); and LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);

4. Check that you have defined the row and column pins correctly in your code. They should be defined as arrays, like this: byte rowPinsROWS = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }; byte colPinsCOLS = { 4, 5, 6, 7 };

5. If none of these solutions work, try restarting the Arduino IDE or even your computer.

If you still can't get the code to work, feel free to reach out to the developer for assistance.
